    \brief  Sound streaming support.

    This file contains declarations for doing streams of sound. This underlies
    pretty much any decoded sounds you might use, including the Ogg Vorbis
    libraries. Note that this does not actually handle decoding, so you'll have
    to worry about that yourself (or use something in kos-ports).

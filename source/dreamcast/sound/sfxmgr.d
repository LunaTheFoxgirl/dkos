/** \file   dc/sound/sfxmgr.h
    \brief  Basic sound effect support.

    This file contains declarations for doing simple sound effects. This code is
    only usable for simple WAV files containing either 16-bit samples (stereo or
    mono) or Yamaha ADPCM (4-bits, stereo or mono). Also, all sounds played in
    this manner must be at most 65534 samples in length, as this does not handle
    buffer chaining or anything else complex. For more interesting stuff, you
    should probably look at the sound stream stuff instead.

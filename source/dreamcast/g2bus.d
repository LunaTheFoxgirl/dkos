/** \file   dc/g2bus.h
    \brief  G2 bus memory interface.

    This file provides low-level support for accessing devices on the G2 bus in
    the Dreamcast. The G2 bus contains the AICA, as well as the expansion port.
    Generally, you won't be dealing with things at this level, but rather on the
    level of the device you're actually interested in working with. Most of the
    expansion port devices (the modem, bba, and lan adapter) all have their own
    drivers that work off of this functionality.

    The G2 bus is notoroiously picky about a lot of things. You have to be
    careful to use the right access size for whatever you're working with. Also
    you can't be doing PIO and DMA at the same time. Finally, there's a FIFO to
    contend with when you're doing PIO stuff as well. Generally, G2 is a pain in
    the rear, so you really do want to be using the higher-level stuff related
    to each device if at all possible!

/* DMA copy from SH-4 RAM to G2 bus (dir = 0) or the opposite;
   length must be a multiple of 32,
   and the source and destination addresses must be aligned on 32-byte
   boundaries. If block is non-zero, this function won't return until
   the transfer is complete. If callback is non-NULL, it will be called
   upon completion (in an interrupt context!). Returns <0 on error.

   Known working combination :

   g2chn = 0, sh4chn = 3 --> mode = 5 (but many other value seems OK ?)
   g2chn = 1, sh4chn = 1 --> mode = 0 (or 4 better ?)
   g2chn = 1, sh4chn = 0 --> mode = 3

   It seems that g2chn is not important when choosing mode, so this mode parameter is probably
   how we actually connect the sh4chn to the g2chn.

   Update : looks like there is a formula, mode = 3 + shchn
